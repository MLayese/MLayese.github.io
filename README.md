[Her Majesty's Beetle Traffic](https://mlayese.github.io/)


For the tasks we split up the workload between making the outline of the website and creating the individual portfoilios for our band members. I focused on making the bulk of the website and added the mp3 file. I took tye clip from the movie "Inside Illewyn Davis". 

Dave and Vincy found links to the other assets (the pictures and youtube link). The only issue we really ran into was we started editing the main branch before we made our own branches. We resolved this with haste so not much time was lost.  I suppose you couod also say our lack of HTML knowledge was a hindrance. Overall, it was a pleasure to work with them.
